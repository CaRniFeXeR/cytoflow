    """ 
    An Experiment manages all the data and metadata for a flow experiment.
    
    A flow cytometry experiment consists of:
      - A set of tubes or wells in a multi-well plate.  Each tube or well
        contains cells subjected to different experimental conditions.
      - An array of events from each well or tube.  Each event is a tuple of 
        measurements of a single cell.
        
    An Experiment is built from a set of FCMeasurement objects, subject to
    a set of constraints:
      - Each FCMeasurement object MUST have identical channels (including
        channel parameters such as PMT voltage and delay.)
      - Each FCMeasurement MUST have a unique set of metadata.
          
    An Experiment object manages all this data.  By "manage", we mean:
      - Get events that match a particular metadata "signature"
      - Add additional metadata to define populations
      - Transform data
          
    Note that nowhere do we mention filters or gates.  You can define gate,
    sure .... but applying that gate to an Experiment simply adds another
    piece of metadata for each event, indicating that the event is in the new
    population or not.  This is in contrast to traditional cytometry tools,
    which allow you to define a tree-like gating "hierarchy."
        
    Finally, an Experiment instance is *versioned*.  That is, when you apply a 
    filter, gate or transformation, you get back a new Experiment with the 
    version attribute incremented.  The old Experiment (version i) retains a
    link to the new Experiment (version i+1), which allows for dynamic updating;
    so if you change the parameters of the filter that created version i, 
    version i+1 can recompute its gates etc.  This isn't an issue for 
    user-defined gates, but if they're data-driven then they need to be updated
    if the (meta)data changes.
        
    This versioning lets an Experiment be smart about data copying, too;
    applying gates or transformations only creates the new columns that it has
    to, and simply uses references to access unchanged data.
        
    Finally, all this is implemented on top of a pandas DataFrame.... which
    earns us all sorts of fun optimization, and lets us select subsets easily:
        
    ex.query('Induced == True') ... etc

    Implementation details
    ----------------------
    
    The OOP programmer in me desperately wanted to subclass DataFrame, add
    some flow-specific stuff, and move on with my life.  A few things get in 
    the way.
    
     - First, to enable some of the delicious syntactic sugar for accessing
       its contents, DataFrame redefines __{get,set}attribute__, and making
       it recognize (and maintain across copies) additional attributes
       is an unsupported (non-public) API feature and introduces other
       subclassing weirdness.
    
     - Second, many of the operations (like appending!) don't happen in-place;
       they return copies instead.  It's cleaner to simply manage that copying
       ourselves instead of making the client deal with it.  we can pretend
       to operate on the data in-place.
       
    To maintain the ease of use, we'll override __getitem__ and pass it to
    the wrapped DataFrame.  We'll do the same with some of the more useful
    DataFrame API pieces (like query()); and of course, you can just get the
    data frame itself with Experiment.data
