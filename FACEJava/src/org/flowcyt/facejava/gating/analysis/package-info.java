 * <p>
 * Contains classes which simplify analyzing Populations with Gates. Analyzer is the
 * main class in this package and allows clients to specify a GateSet and Populations
 * to analyze with the GateSet and returns Result classes with the results of the
 * analyses. Since Gates do return their own sub populations after analyses analysis
 * package doesn't have to be used for all gating.
