 * <p>
 * Contains the classes needed for the implementation of all the different geometric 
 * Gates that are defined in the Gating-ML standard. Geometric, in this case, is where
 * the Gate defines some sort of shape (2D) or solid (>3D), where Events are inside the Gate if
 * they are within the shape or solid. Geometric Gates are Polygon, Rectangular, Polytope
 * and Ellipsoid gates.
