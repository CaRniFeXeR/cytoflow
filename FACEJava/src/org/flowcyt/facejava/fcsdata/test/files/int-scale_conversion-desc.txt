Integer Data

None of the other test files need conversion from channel to scale (i.e., $PnG = 1 or is not given and $PnE = 0,0)
So this file tests conversion of both linear and log parameters.

2 Parameters - FS, LOG
FS: is linear with gain of 10
LOG: is logarithmic with $PnE: 4,0; $PnR: 1024; and $PnG: 10 (which should be ignored during conversion)

3 events - Channel Values in the FCS files are
(256, 256)
(512, 512)
(768, 768)

Converted to scale, these events should be:
(25.6, 10)
(51.2, 100)
(76.8, 1000)
