 * Contains the implementations of the interfaces in org.flowcyt.fcsdata necessary to
 * represent FCS files. These classes are specifically designed to model the data in
 * and FCS file and are not general-purpose implementations of the fcsdata interfaces.
 * These classes should be avoided in favor of the fcsdata interfaces. They should 
 * only be used where it only makes sense to work with data from an FCS file.
