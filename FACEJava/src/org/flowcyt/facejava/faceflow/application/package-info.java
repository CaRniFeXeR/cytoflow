 * <p>
 * Contains classes specific for the implementation of the FACEFlow command line
 * application. The application is meant to be a simple tool which can process relations
 * and output analyzed Populations as FCS files. Its main goal is to show how the
 * different libraries can be used together. The classes in this package (and in the
 * subpackages) are not for general use. See the FACEFlow README for more information
 * about the application.
