Take a look at some example [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks:\r\n\r\n* [Basic flow cytometry analysis](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/bpteague/cytoflow/blob/master/docs/examples-basic/Basic%20Cytometry.ipynb)\r\n* [An small-molecule induction curve with yeast](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/bpteague/cytoflow/blob/master/docs/examples-basic/Yeast%20Dose%20Reponse.ipynb)\r\n* [Data-driven gating with gaussian mixture models](https://github.com/bpteague/cytoflow/blob/master/docs/examples-basic/Machine%20Learning.ipynb)\r\n* [Reproduced some analysis from a published paper](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bpteague/cytoflow-examples/blob/master/kiani/Kiani%20Nature%20Methods%202014.ipynb)\r\n* [Calibrated flow cytometry in MEFLs](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bpteague/cytoflow-examples/blob/master/tasbe/TASBE%20Workflow.ipynb)\r\n\r\n### What's wrong with other packages?  \r\n\r\nPackages such as FACSDiva and FlowJo are focused on primarily on identifying\r\nand counting subpopulations of cells in a multi-channel flow cytometry\r\nexperiment.  While this is important for many different applications, it\r\nreflects flow cytometry's origins in separating mixtures of cells based on\r\ndifferential staining of their cell surface markers.\r\n\r\nCytometers can also be used to measure internal cell state, frequently as\r\nreported by fluorescent proteins such as GFP.  In this context, they function\r\nin a manner similar to a high-powered plate-reader: instead of reporting the\r\nsum fluorescence of a population of cells, the cytometer shows you the\r\n*distribution* of the cells' fluorescence.  Thinking in terms of distributions,\r\nand how those distributions change as you vary an experimental variable, is\r\nsomething existing packages don't handle gracefully.\r\n\r\n### What's different about CytoFlow?\r\n\r\nA few things.\r\n\r\n* **Free and open-source.**  Use the software free-of-charge; modify it to\r\n  suit your own needs, then contribute your changes back so the rest of the\r\n  community can benefit from them.\r\n\r\n* Provides both **Python modules** (relatively complete) and a \r\n  **point-and-click interface** (still in development) \r\n\r\n* An emphasis on **metadata**.  CytoFlow assumes that you are measuring\r\n  fluorescence on several samples that were treated differently: either\r\n  they were collected at different times, treated with varying levels\r\n  of inducers, etc.  You specify the conditions for each sample up front,\r\n  then use those conditions to facet the analysis.\r\n\r\n* Cytometry analysis conceptualized as a **workflow**.  Raw cytometry data\r\n  is usually not terribly useful: you may gate out cellular debris and \r\n  aggregates (using FSC and SSC channels), then compensate for channel\r\n  bleed-through, and finally select only transfected cells before actually\r\n  looking at the parameters you're interested in experimentally.  CytoFlow\r\n  implements a workflow paradigm, where operations are applied sequentially;\r\n  a workflow can be saved and re-used, or shared with your coworkers.\r\n\r\n* **Easy to use.**  Sane defaults; good documentation; focused on doing one\r\n  thing and doing it well.\r\n\r\n* **Good visualization.**  I don't know about you, but I'm getting really\r\n  tired of FACSDiva plots.\r\n\r\n* **Versatile.**  Built on Python, with a well-defined\r\n  library of operations and visualizations that are well separated from\r\n  the user interface.  Need an analysis that CytoFlow doesn't have?  Export \r\n  your workflow to an IPython notebook and use any Python module you want to \r\n  complete your analysis.  Data is stored in a pandas.DataFrame, which is \r\n  rapidly becoming the standard for Python data management (and will make R\r\n  users feel right at home.)\r\n  \r\n* **Extensible.**  Adding a new analysis module is simple; the interface to\r\n  implement is only two or three functions.\r\n\r\n* **Quantitative and tatistically sound.** Ready access to useful data-driven tools for\r\n  analysis, such as fitting 2-dimensional Gaussians for automated gating\r\n  and mixture modeling.  ``cytoflow`` discourages (but does not prevent) wholesale\r\n  rescaling of data, for example using the ``log10`` operation.  Instead, it\r\n  encourages rescaling of the data's **plots** instead.\r\n\r\n#### Note: this is still beta software!  Caveat emptor!\r\n  \r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nSee the [installation notes](http://cytoflow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/INSTALL.html) on [ReadTheDocs](http://cytoflow.readthedocs.org/).  Installation has been tested\r\non Linux (Ubuntu Trusty) and Windows 7 (x86_64).  Mac installation should be similar.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThere is some basic documentation at [ReadTheDocs](http://cytoflow.readthedocs.org/).\r\nPerhaps of most use is the [module index](http://cytoflow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py-modindex.html).\r\nThe example [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks, above, demonstrate how the package\r\nis intended to be used interactively.\r\n\r\n### Required packages\r\n\r\nThese are all in the `setuptools` spec.\r\n\r\nFor the core `cytoflow` library, you need the following Python packages:\r\n```\r\npython >= 2.7\r\npandas >= 0.17.0\r\nnumpy >= 1.9.0\r\nnumexpr >= 2.1\r\nbottleneck >= 1.0\r\nmatplotlib == 1.4.3\r\nscipy >= 0.14\r\nscikit-learn >= 0.16\r\nseaborn >= 0.7.0\r\ntraits >= 4.0\r\nfcsparser >= 0.1.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the GUI, you additionally need:\r\n```\r\npyface == 4.4.0\r\nenvisage >= 4.0\r\npyqt >= 4.10 -- this must be installed separately!\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that many of these packages have additional dependencies, including\r\nbut not limited to `traitsui`, `decorator`, etc.\r\nEverything except PyQT should be a well well-behaved PyPI package; you should be\r\nable to install all the above with `pip install` or the Canopy package manager.\r\n\r\n",
