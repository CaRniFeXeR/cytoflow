Welcome to Cytoflow!
====================

**********************************************
I want to install the point-and-click program.
**********************************************

You can download binaries for Windows, MacOS and Linux from the
`GitHub project page <http://bpteague.github.io/cytoflow/>`_.

**********************************************************
I want to see the point-and-click program's documentation.

>>>>>>> 9522eaf docs: refactor documentation (in progress)

Here's the :ref:`user's manual <user_manual>`, or jump straight to 
a :ref:`tutorial <user_quickstart>`. 

<<<<<<< Upstream, based on master
  conda config --add channels cytoflow
  conda create --name cytoflow cytoflow 
  
This creates a new Anaconda environment named ``cytoflow`` and installs the 
latest package from the Anaconda Cloud.

*****************************************************************
I want to write my own cytometry analysis pipeline in Python 3.x.

>>>>>>> 9522eaf docs: refactor documentation (in progress)

Head over to the :ref:`developer's manual <dev_manual>`, or have a
look at :ref:`some example Jupyter notebooks <dev_tutorials>`.


********************************
I want to help develop Cytoflow.
********************************

<<<<<<< Upstream, based on master
Hooray!  Have a look at the :ref:`install documentation <hacking>` for how to
get the source code installed.  Then, have a look at the  
:ref:`design docs <design>` and the :ref:`new modules <new_modules>` documentation.
Finally, join us over at 
`the cytoflow GitHub repo <https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow>`_ to file bugs, submit PRs, etc.

Hooray!  We'd love to have you.

* First, see the :ref:`install documentation <hacking>` for how to get the 
  source code installed.  
* Next have a look at the  :ref:`design documents <design>` to understand how
  Cytoflow is put together.
* Finally, join us over at 
  `the cytoflow GitHub repo <https://github.com/bpteague/cytoflow>`_ to file 
  bugs, submit PRs, etc.
