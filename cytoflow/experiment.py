    """An Experiment manages all the data and metadata for a flow experiment.
    
    A flow cytometry experiment consists of:
      - A set of tubes or wells in a multi-well plate.  Each tube or well
        contains cells subjected to different experimental conditions.
      - An array of events from each well or tube.  Each event is a tuple of 
        measurements of a single cell.
        
    ....subject to the following constraints:

      - Each tube or well MUST have identical channels (including channel 
        parameters such as PMT voltage and delay.)
      - Each tube or well MUST have a unique set of metadata.
          
    An Experiment object manages all this data.  By "manage", we mean:
      - Get events that match a particular metadata "signature"
      - Add additional metadata to define populations, etc.

    NOTE: `Experiment` is not responsible for enforcing the constraints; 
    `cytoflow.ImportOp` is.  Which is to say, you can break these rules if
    you need to.  I don't recommend it.  (-;
    
    Attributes
    ----------

    data : pandas.DataFrame
        the `DataFrame` representing all the events and metadata.  Each event
        is a row; each column is either a measured channel (ie a fluorescence
        measurement), a derived channel (eg the ratio between two channels), or
        a piece of metadata.  Metadata can be either supplied by the tube 
        conditions (eg induction level, timepoint) or by operations (eg gate
        membership)
        
    metadata : Dict(Str : Any)
        The experimental metadata.  In particular, each column in self.data has
        an entry whose key is the column name and whose value is a dict of
        column-specific metadata. Operations may define their own metadata, 
        which is occasionally useful if modules are expected to work together.
        An incomplete list of column-specific metadata:
        * type (Enum: "channel", "category", "float", "int", "bool") : what kind
            of data is stored in this column?  If the column is event
            measurement data (raw, transformed, or derived), then the value is 
            "channel".  If the column is per-event metadata, then the value is
            a NumPy `dtype` -- `category`, `float`, `int`, or `bool`.
        * voltage (int) : for channels, the detector voltage used. from the FCS
            keyword "$PnV".
        * range (float) : for channels, the maximum possible value.  from the FCS
            keyword "$PnR"
        * repr : for float conditions, whether to plot it linearly or on
            a log scale.
        * xforms, xforms_inv: for channels, a list of (parameterized!) 
            transformations that have been applied.  each must be a
            one-parameter function that takes either a single value or a list 
            of values and applies the transformation (or inverse).  necessary
            for computing tic marks on plots, among other things.
            
        Note! There may be *other* experiment-wide things in `metadata`; 
        the fact that a key is in `metadata` does not mean a corresponding
        column exists in `data`.
    
    channels : List(String)
        A read-only `List` containing the channels that this experiment tracks.
    
    conditions : Dict(String : String)
        A read-only Dict of the experimental conditions and analysis metadata 
        (gate membership, etc) and that this experiment tracks.  The key is the 
        name of the condition, and the value is the string representation of the 
        `numpy` dtype (usually one of "category", "float", "int" or "bool".)
        
    Notes
    -----              
      
    Note that nowhere do we mention filters or gates.  You can define gate,
    sure .... but applying that gate to an Experiment simply adds another
    condition for each event, indicating that the event is in the new
    population or not.  This is in contrast to traditional cytometry tools,
    which allow you to define a tree-like gating "hierarchy."
        
    Finally, all this is implemented on top of a pandas DataFrame.... which
    earns us all sorts of fun optimization, and lets us select subsets easily:
        
    >>> ex.query('Induced == True') 

    Implementation details
    ----------------------
    
    The OOP programmer in me desperately wanted to subclass DataFrame, add
    some flow-specific stuff, and move on with my life.  (I may still, with
    something like https://github.com/dalejung/pandas-composition).  A few 
    things get in the way of directly subclassing pandas.DataFrame:
    
     - First, to enable some of the delicious syntactic sugar for accessing
       its contents, DataFrame redefines ``__getattribute__`` and 
       ``__setattribute__``, and making it recognize (and maintain across 
       copies) additional attributes is an unsupported (non-public) API 
       feature and introduces other subclassing weirdness.
    
     - Second, many of the operations (like appending!) don't happen in-place;
       they return copies instead.  It's cleaner to simply manage that copying
       ourselves instead of making the client deal with it.  we can pretend
       to operate on the data in-place.
       
    To maintain the ease of use, we'll override __getitem__ and pass it to
    the wrapped DataFrame.  We'll do the same with some of the more useful
    DataFrame API pieces (like query()); and of course, you can just get the
    data frame itself with Experiment.data
