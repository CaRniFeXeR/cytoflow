    Attributes
    ----------
    name : Str
        The operation name.  Used to name the new metadata field in the
        experiment that's created by apply()
        
    xchannel : Str
        The name of the first channel to apply the range gate.
        
    ychannel : Str
        The name of the second channel to apply the range gate.
        
    polygon : List((Float, Float))
        The polygon verticies.  An ordered list of 2-tuples, representing
        the x and y coordinates of the vertices.
        
    Notes
    -----
    This module uses `matplotlib.path.Path` to represent the polygon, because
    membership testing is very fast.
    
    You can set the verticies by hand, I suppose, but it's much easier to use
    the `PolygonSelection` view to do so.  Unfortunately, it's currently very
    slow in the GUI and impossible to use in an IPython notebook.

        ----------
        experiment : Experiment
            the old experiment to which this op is applied

        -------
            a new experiment, the same as old_experiment but with a new
