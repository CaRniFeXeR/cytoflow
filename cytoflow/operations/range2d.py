    Attributes
    ----------
    name : Str
        The operation name.  Used to name the new metadata field in the
        experiment that's created by apply()
        
    xchannel : Str
        The name of the first channel to apply the range gate.
        
    xlow : Float
        The lowest value in xchannel to include in this gate.
        
    xhigh : Float
        The highest value in xchannel to include in this gate.
        
    ychannel : Str
        The name of the secon channel to apply the range gate.
        
    ylow : Float
        The lowest value in ychannel to include in this gate.
        
    yhigh : Float
        The highest value in ychannel to include in this gate.
