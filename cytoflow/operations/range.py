    Attributes
    ----------
    name : Str
        The operation name.  Used to name the new metadata field in the
        experiment that's created by apply()
        
    channel : Str
        The name of the channel to apply the range gate.
        
    low : Float
        The lowest value to include in this gate.
        
    high : Float
        The highest value to include in this gate.
        
    Examples
    --------
    >>> range = flow.RangeOp()
    >>> range.name = "Y2-A+"
    >>> range.channel = 'Y2-A'
    >>> range.low = 0.3
    >>> range.high = 0.8
    >>> 
    >>> ex3 = range.apply(ex2)
    
    Alternately  (in an IPython notebook with `%matplotlib notebook`)
    
    >>> h = flow.HistogramView()
    >>> h.channel = 'Y2-A'
    >>> rs = flow.RangeSelection(view = h)
    >>> rs.plot(ex2)
    >>> rs.interactive = True
    >>> # ... draw a range on the plot ....
    >>> range.low, range.high = rs.low, rs.high
    >>> ex3 = range.apply(ex2)
