    Attributes
    ----------
    name : Str
        The name of the transformation (for UI representation, optional for
        interactive use)
        
    channels : List(Str)
        A list of the channels on which to apply the transformation
        
    b: Float (default = 500)
        The point at which the transform transitions from linear to log.
        The keys are channel names and the values are transition points for
        each channel; if a channel in `channels` isn't specified here, the 
        default value of 500 is used.
    
    r: Float (default = 10**4)  
        The maximum of the transformed values.
