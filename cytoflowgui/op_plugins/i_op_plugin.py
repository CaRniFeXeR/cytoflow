        Return an instance of a traitsui View for the operation we wrap.
        
        There's a lot of logic you can stuff into a view (enums, visible_when,
        etc.)  If you need more logic, though, feel free to define a Controller
        and use that to handle, eg, button presses or derived traits (eg,
        with a Property trait)
