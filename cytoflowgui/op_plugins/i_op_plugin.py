        Return a traitsui View for the IOperation this plugin wraps
        
        There's a lot of logic you can stuff into a view (enums, visible_when,
        etc.)  If you need more logic, though, feel free to define a Controller
        and use that to handle, eg, button presses or derived traits (eg,
        with a Property trait)
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        wi : WorkflowItem
            the WorkflowItem that wraps this Operation; lets us access the 
            previous and current operation results.
