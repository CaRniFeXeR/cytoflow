#from cytoflowgui import matplotlib_multiprocess_backend

# THE NEW NEW PLAN combines both:
# The parent process runs the GUI
# The child process holds the data
# When a WI needs to run in the child process, it runs the operation
# in grandchild process, which sends back just the changed columns.
# threads are used to listen for status updates, passed back as new
# WI instances (though we'll have to break the update loop somewhere!)

# THE NEW PLAN: when a WorkflowItem runs, it will kick off a new process.
# that new process will be passed the previous WI's result and the 
# operation (which should be FAST because of process cloning, at least on
# Linux and Mac.) the new process will run the operation on the data,
# collect the result, then do a column-by-column comparison of the two
# and send new and changed columns back to the parent process.  the 
# parent process's WI will construct a result out of the previous WI's
# result and the changed columns from the child process.

# THE OLD PLAN:
# (the old plan has problems with orphaned processes.)

# multiprocessing and multithreading plan:

# the parent process maintains the GUI and a copy of the model but with 
# NO DATA.  all the actual data processing happens in a child process, 
# which maintains its own list of WorkflowItems that actually have the
# data and do the processing.

# 

# pair of child 
# processes, the "valid" process and the "running" process.  the "valid"
# process contains a workflow for which all the WorkflowItems' states
# are "valid" or "invalid"; the "running" process is allowed to have
# workflow items that are "estimating" or "applying".

# the order of operations is as follows:  in the parent process, we
# start with all the WorkflowItems in the "valid" state.  the "valid"
# process contains a copy of the parent workflow, with actual Experiment
# instances in the "result" traits.

# assume that the user changes a parameter in one of the operations.
# the parent process serializes the changed Operation and sends it
# through a pipe to the "valid" process.  the "valid" process updates
# its copy of the operation, then spawns a subprocess (the "running"
# process) and returns its handler and a pipe connection to the parent.

# the "running" process actually runs the operation.  when the operation
# is finished, it informs the parent process.  the parent process
# terminates the "valid" process and makes the "running" process the
# "valid" process.  then, the new "valid" process spawns a new "running"
# process, which runs the next invalid operation.  the process continues
# until all the operations have run.

# there are several advantages to this setup.  first, there are never
# more than two processes that have the actual data, so the in-memory
# size should never grow beyond twice the size of the same pipeline
# in a Jupyter notebook.  and it should be very fast, at least on 
# Linux and MacOS, because spawning a new process gets a copy of all
# the variables from the old one.

# second, it is not uncommon to have an operation's parameters update
# while that operation is running.  this is actually the original
# motivation for multiprocessing: when a long-running operation is
# running, it holds the Python global interpreter lock (GIL) and thus
# freezes the GUI.

# pipe connections for communicating between canvases
