    # THE NEW NEW PLAN combines both:
    # The parent process runs the GUI
    # The child process holds the data
    # When a WI needs to run in the child process, it runs the operation
    # in grandchild process, which sends back just the changed columns.
    # threads are used to listen for status updates, passed back as new
    # WI instances (though we'll have to break the update loop somewhere!)
    
    # THE NEW PLAN: when a WorkflowItem runs, it will kick off a new process.
    # that new process will be passed the previous WI's result and the 
    # operation (which should be FAST because of process cloning, at least on
    # Linux and Mac.) the new process will run the operation on the data,
    # collect the result, then do a column-by-column comparison of the two
    # and send new and changed columns back to the parent process.  the 
    # parent process's WI will construct a result out of the previous WI's
    # result and the changed columns from the child process.
    
    # THE OLD PLAN:
    # (the old plan has problems with orphaned processes.)
    
    # multiprocessing and multithreading plan:
    
    # the parent process maintains the GUI and a copy of the model but with 
    # NO DATA.  all the actual data processing happens in a child process, 
    # which maintains its own list of WorkflowItems that actually have the
    # data and do the processing.
    
    # 
    
    # pair of child 
    # processes, the "valid" process and the "running" process.  the "valid"
    # process contains a workflow for which all the WorkflowItems' states
    # are "valid" or "invalid"; the "running" process is allowed to have
    # workflow items that are "estimating" or "applying".
    
    # the order of operations is as follows:  in the parent process, we
    # start with all the WorkflowItems in the "valid" state.  the "valid"
    # process contains a copy of the parent workflow, with actual Experiment
    # instances in the "result" traits.
    
    # assume that the user changes a parameter in one of the operations.
    # the parent process serializes the changed Operation and sends it
    # through a pipe to the "valid" process.  the "valid" process updates
    # its copy of the operation, then spawns a subprocess (the "running"
    # process) and returns its handler and a pipe connection to the parent.
    
    # the "running" process actually runs the operation.  when the operation
    # is finished, it informs the parent process.  the parent process
    # terminates the "valid" process and makes the "running" process the
    # "valid" process.  then, the new "valid" process spawns a new "running"
    # process, which runs the next invalid operation.  the process continues
    # until all the operations have run.
    
    # there are several advantages to this setup.  first, there are never
    # more than two processes that have the actual data, so the in-memory
    # size should never grow beyond twice the size of the same pipeline
    # in a Jupyter notebook.  and it should be very fast, at least on 
    # Linux and MacOS, because spawning a new process gets a copy of all
    # the variables from the old one.
    
    # second, it is not uncommon to have an operation's parameters update
    # while that operation is running.  this is actually the original
    # motivation for multiprocessing: when a long-running operation is
    # running, it holds the Python global interpreter lock (GIL) and thus
    # freezes the GUI.
